<h2>Multishine</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This is an iteration on my second digital assignment.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game now has multiple controls, and I had to modify some of phaser's settings to ensure right click could be used in-game.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
Working multiple sprites into my games, disabling on-click events.<br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
Well most of the infrastructure of the game was there already, so it was overall pretty easy to make.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
I created the falcon image in gimp.<br>
<br>
See digital assignment 2 for all other asset credits
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest other game is the one I iterated on, digital assignment 2<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player must try to help fox and falco shine as many times as possible in 20 seconds by clicking on the two of them with the correct clicks.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It was an iteration, so it used the challenge from that week, which was that it takes exactly 20 seconds to play.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game is by and large deterministic with some minor randomness.<br>
<br>I can't really think of a genre classification other than "arcade"<br>
<br>The playstyle is largely precision-based, although the spots that fox and falco go to are random<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Sprite interaction/functions as well as playing sound effects on specific events.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
My main goal is for players to get an arcadey try-to-get-a-highscore feeling.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players help fox perform a shine by left clicking on him, and help falco shine by right clicking on him, wherever they may go to on the stage. Streaks get you bonus score! Click to Start!<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players who are able to be as accurate as possible with their clicks, as well as using the correct click for the right space animal will have the highest score.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game, you are helping fox/falco to practice his waveshine and multishine tech! They needs to be in top shape for his next tournament, so try to help them shine at least 40 times in 20 seconds!
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who like precision-based games and those who are fans of Super Smash Brothers.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
20 Seconds<br><br>
</li>
