<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
While collecting objects was something you could do in the base code, collecting a certain number didn't do anything in particular.<br>
I made it so that collecting all of the chemicals is a win condition.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I added a cherry powerup that boosts the players jump when collected.<br> 
<br>
I made it so that a few of the chemicals stay at the top of the screen, so that players must use the powerups strategically.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The most technical thing I added was the powerups that boost the player's jump<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
Mostly how to implement base code, but also how to create child objects, and how to edit properties of those objects.<br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
The easiest part was actually editing properies of objects, since all I had to do was check some of the documentation to see what was possible.<br>
<br>
The hardest part was implementing the base code into my github website, since a lot of the time it resulted in a black screen.<br>
It took me a few hours at least to actually get any kind of working prototype up and running.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
All assets I used were created by Kenney<br>
<br>
Royalty free music by Kevin Macleod<br><br>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Base Code I Used: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/basic-platform">Basic Platform
</a> <br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player must collect (clean up) all of the chemical flasks on the level to pass the level<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the chemist theme<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
<br>While the game is largely deterministic, it is random which chemicals will stay at the top of the screen.<br>
<br>The game is a platformer, but in some regards is also like a puzzle game too.<br>
<br>The playstyle is more strategic than precision-based, since the player has a limited number of powerups.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
<br>Primarily jump boosting powerups<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<br>What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
<br>I mostly want players to feel satisfaction upon using powerups in a strategic fashion to collect the chemicals<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<br>Players can perform basic movement, such as moving left and right, as well as jumping with the arrow keys. The core mechanic is collecting the chemical tokens. This can be aided through the use of cherry powerups which boost the robots jump.<br>
However, players may find that if they waste their powerups, the level may be unbeatable.<br><br>
Powerups aren't necessarily limited to just shooting the player up or only for collecting specific chemicals. They may be used to perform all sorts of movement, whether that be shooting a player forward, teleporting, or moving to a specific part of the level/towards other powerups<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
<br>I expect that the players who plan out which powerups they should use for which chemical tokens will be the most successful in this game.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
<br>
In this game, you control a robot in a lab. A few of the scientists dropped some very toxic chemicals and are relying on you to collect them so that they can continue working. While the premise is a little serious, the actual gameplay is more casual, so the dramatic and gameplay tensions don't really clash too hard.
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br><br>
The target demographic is players who enjoy platformers with puzzle-like elements.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br><br>
Each level shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to play out once you've figured out the solution.<br>
</li>
