<h2>Harold Pro Skater</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I think the general gameplay loop I went for this week is somewhat common, but I spiced things up with increasing speed, and variable obstacle size.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game's most technical aspect was the jump mechanics that I programmed. I tried to make it feel closer to something like the jump in Super Mario Bros, where letting go of the jump button would cause a jump to end early.<br>
Unfortunately I didn't get it completely the way I wanted it, and to do so, I'd need to control acceleration as well I think.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
How to more precisely control a character, adding different velocities to the player, and controlling those velocities with booleans.<br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
The hardest part was getting the cone with variable size to reset properly every time, since it would fall through the floor at some sizes in playtesting.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

I created the player character by splicing a stock photo with a piece of clipart.<br>
<br>
All other assets I used were created by Kenney, save for the traffic cone, which was clipart.<br>
<br>
Royalty free music by Kevin Macleod.<br><br>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I didn't base this game off of any specific title, although I tried to create a game that was similar to the old flash game Ski Runner, which had increasing difficulty through increased game speed.
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player takes control of Harold, looking to reclaim his youth by doing sick ollies on his skateboard!<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the elderly person theme<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.<br>
<br>The game is deterministic, relying heavily on player reaction time and spacing.<br>
<br>The game is a platformer-esque, with some arcadey elements.<br>
<br>The playstyle is highly precision-based.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?<br>
<br>Variable jump heights<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
<br>What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?<br>
<br>I mostly want players to feel the excitement and hecticness of controlling a character that is moving too fast.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<br>Players can perform horizontal movement. The core mechanic, however is the jumping, which can be ended early to fall faster, potentially allowing the player to dodge more obstacles.<br><br>
If I had more development time I might add powerups, or scaling gravity, to allow players the opportunity for more skillful gameplay.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?<br>
<br>I expect that the players who let go of the jump button to start falling as soon as they clear each cone will be the most successful in this game.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br>
<br>
In this game, you control Harold, who is sick and tired of being seen as an old fogey. He decides that the only way to break out of his image is to become a professional skater, so you must help him control his skateboard as he practices.
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.<br><br>
The target demographic is players who enjoy platformers.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?<br><br>
Generally less than a minute, but technically could go for a little longer.<br>
</li>
