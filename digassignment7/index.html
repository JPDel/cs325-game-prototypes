<h2>Asteroid Attack</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is somewhat original, in that it involves the player making constant risk/reward decisions during gameplay, and considering when would be a good idea to drop off their materials.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game is not particularly technically advanced, although some noteworthy things to mention are that the speed of the pirate increases with carried minerals.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
Mostly that its much more difficult than I realized to translate a physical prototype to a digital prototype!<br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
The hardest part was getting the minerals to spawn in the right location, and even as of now they are a little buggy.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
Many of the sprites and backgrounds were downloaded from royalty free png and clipart websites, such as pluspng.org, hiclipart.com, and pinclipart.com<br>
The player and pirate sprites were created by Kenney<br>
<br>
Music was downloaded from Kevin Macleods website: <a href="https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=usuan1400011">Imcompetech</a>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This is a digital sequence game, so its closest other game is my physical prototype that we playtested last week. Other than that it shares some bits of code from previous games I've made, particularly my digital assignment 3; although I would say that they are entirely different games. As for translating the physical prototype to digital, I had to change a few things that I hope to update next week, like adding more pirates, or mineral values, etc.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players must take the role of an asteroid miner and avoid the pirate that wants to take your minerals.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
No theme was used for this game<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
There is very little luck involved in this game, although it can be a bit unpredictable at times. I made it this way to encourage high amounts of risk/reward planning.<br>
<br>I can't really think of a genre classification other than "arcade"<br>
<br>The game is highly deterministic, and everything that happens has a very obvious effect.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
My goal for this prototype is to translate my physical prototype as well as possible.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
My main goal is for players to feel the effects of their risk/reward decisions. For example, if they lose, I would like them to think "Maybe I should have been carrying fewer materials this time."<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players move forward by pressing the up key, and rotate with left and right. The goal is to collect as many minerals as possible while avoiding the pirate, who is constantly barreling towards you. The pirate gains speed for every mineral the player is carrying, and will subsequently slow when the player deposits their minerals.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I think that the players who find just the right amount of minerals to carry for each trip will have the optimal completion time.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game, you play as a miner on the lookout for minerals at a nearby asteroid. Pirates are on the loose though, so don't carry too many on each trip to and from the space station.
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think this game can appeal to most audiences.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes<br><br>
