<h2>Multishine</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The original code only only had a controllable sprite, I added an objective, all new assets, an enemy that follows you, and a scoring system.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game relies a lot on randomness to determine quite a few things, including spawn locations, score values, and even player/enemy sizes. Although it doesn't look very flashy, while food sizes are randomized, their point values are not. (i.e. each randomly generated food has a set point value that corresponds to its size.)<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
Mostly how to tweak specific functions in phaser. There was a setDrag function that I played around a lot with before I settled on a final value. Additionally, I'm getting more used to adding random elements, and understanding what works and what doesn't when it comes to randomness.<br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
The easiest part was definitely adding assets and foundational code, as those were things that I learned how to do in previous weeks.<br>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
I downloaded the sprite assets royalty free here: <a href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-fishing-game-assets-pixel-art-pack/">Fish Assets</a><br>
<br>

Music was downloaded from Kevin Macleods website: <a href="https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=usuan1400011">Imcompetech</a>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Base Code I Used: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/physics/arcade/asteroids-movement">Asteroids Movement
</a>
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players must take the role of a fish in the ocean, and attempt to find food while avoiding a dangerous shark.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The game challenge I used was "randomize something that traditionally would not be randomized."<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
My game is heavily reliant on luck, although the player does have some amount of control of the game.<br>
<br>I can't really think of a genre classification other than "arcade"<br>
<br>Many elements of the game are randomized; The only unrandomized values are player/shark speed, and the point values for specifically sized fish.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I really wanted to see how far I could push random elements while still feeling fair to the player.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
My main goal is for players to get an arcadey try-to-get-a-highscore feeling.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players move forward by pressing the up key, and rotate with left and right. The goal is to collect as many food fish as possible while avoiding the shark, who is constantly barreling towards you.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players must rely a bit on luck to get a good spawn location, and then must use their instincts to avoid the shark. Luckily players can wrap around the screen, but the shark cannot, so players who can abuse that will get the highest score.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game, you play as a very hungry fish, although watch out! You aren't the only one looking for a snack.
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think this game can appeal to most anyone. Unless you have a fear of fish.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as you can survive!!<br><br>
</li>
