<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
While collecting objects was something you could do in the base code, collecting a certain number didn't do anything in particular.<br>
I made it so that collecting all of the chemicals is a win condition.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I added a cherry powerup that boosts the players jump when collected.<br> 
<br>
I made it so that a few of the chemicals stay at the top of the screen, so that players must use the powerups strategically.<br>
<br></li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The most technical thing I added was the powerups that boost the player's jump<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br>
<br>
How to <br>
<br>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?<br>
<br>
The easiest part was actually editing properies of objects, since all I had to do was check some of the documentation to see what was possible.<br>
<br>
The hardest part was implementing the base code into my github website, since a lot of the time it resulted in a black screen.<br>
It took me a few hours at least to actually get any kind of working prototype up and running.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
I created the fox image in gimp<br>
<br>
Music from the following soundcloud: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hopelessmope/dreamland-guitar">Gourmet Race for Four Guitars</a><br>
<br>
Pixel art by Daniel Bernal: <a href="https://bernalstudio.com/projects/oOzAYO">Bernal Studio</a>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Base Code I Used: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/time/remove-timer-event">Remove Timer Event
</a> <br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player must try to help fox shine as many times as possible in 20 seconds by clicking on him<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The game challenge I used was that it takes exactly 20 seconds to play<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<br>
<br>The game is by and large deterministic with some minor randomness<br>
<br>I can't really think of a genre classification other than "arcade"<br>
<br>The playstyle is largely precision-based, although the spots that fox goes to are random<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Sprite interaction/functions as well as playing sound effects on specific events<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
My main goal is for players to get an arcadey try-to-get-a-highscore feeling<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players help fox perform a shine by clicking on him, wherever he may go to on the stage.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players who are able to react quickly and be very accurate with their clicks will have the highest score<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this game, you are helping fox to practice his waveshine and multishine tech! Try to help fox shine at least 50 times in 20 seconds!
<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who like precision-based games and those who are fans of Super Smash Brothers<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
20 Seconds<br><br>
</li>
